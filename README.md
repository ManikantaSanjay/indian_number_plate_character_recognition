# indian_number_plate_character_recognition
## Libraries used:

i>Keras

ii>Tensorflow

iii>Matplotlib

iv>OpenCV

## Description:
This model involves performing 3 tasks.

I> Extracting number plate from the image of the vehicle.

II> Find contours and try to draw rectangles around each character of the number plate.

III> The model training is done on a dataset containing 36 classes,which are 'A'-'Z' and 0-9 using a CNN model architecture with softmax activation function.

IV> Later,the model prediction is compared with the characters in the number plate.

## Outcome:
94% accuracy is achieved using a small number of epochs run.
