## About

This model involves performing 4 tasks.

- Extracting number plate from the image of the vehicle.
- Find contours and try to draw rectangles around each character of the number plate.
- The model training is done on a dataset containing 36 classes,which are 'A'-'Z' and 0-9 using a CNN model architecture.
- Finally, the model prediction is compared with the characters in the number plate.



## Python Libraries Used

- Keras
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

 
## Result
94% accuracy was achieved on the test dataset.
